# Real-time LTC Area Lights
This project is based on the paper "Real-time polygonal-light shading with linearly transformed cosines" in 2017. A total of 4 area light types are
implemented in the project using LTC method.

## TODO
1. Since OpenGL doesnâ€™t support ray tracing, I plan to migrate this project later into Falcor and use DXR to calculate the soft shadows for those area lights  
2. Inserting more area light types like star, cubic, torus, etc  
3. When using normal mapping and transferring all the shading data into tangent space, it would cause mismatching problems in the LTC lookup table. So, I have to transform all normals into world space in the fragment shader which is not a good choice  
4. I just displace the vertex position in a ripple effect. It would be better to reconstruct the normals for those new positions
